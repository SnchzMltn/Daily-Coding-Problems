# 1 - Create rand functions

This problem was asked by Two Sigma.

Using a function rand7() that returns an integer from 1 to 7 (inclusive) with uniform probability, implement a function rand5() that returns an integer from 1 to 5 (inclusive).

# 2

This problem was asked by Slack.

You are given a string formed by concatenating several words corresponding to the integers zero through nine and then anagramming.

For example, the input could be 'niesevehrtfeev', which is an anagram of 'threefiveseven'. Note that there can be multiple instances of each integer.

Given this string, return the original integers in sorted order. In the example above, this would be 357.

# 3

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Print the nodes in a binary tree level-wise. For example, the following should print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

```
  1
 / \
2   3
   / \
  4   5
```

# 4

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

# 5

Design and implement a HitCounter class that keeps track of requests (or hits). It should support the following operations:

    - record(timestamp): records a hit that happened at timestamp
    - total(): returns the total number of hits recorded
    - range(lower, upper): returns the number of hits that occurred between timestamps lower and upper (inclusive)

Follow-up: What if our system has limited memory?
